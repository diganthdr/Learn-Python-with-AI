### Assignment: Integrating dbops.py with User Input for Database Operations

#### Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to use the functions defined in dbops.py to interact with a database by collecting user inputs. You will create a new file called `userentry.py` to handle user input and perform database operations such as inserting, updating, and deleting records.

---

#### Instructions:

1. **Setup**:
   - Ensure you have the dbops.py file in the same directory as your new file.
   - The dbops.py file contains functions for connecting to the database, creating tables, and performing CRUD operations.

2. **Create a New File**:
   - Create a new Python file named `userentry.py`.

3. **User Input for Database Operations**:
   - In `userentry.py`, write a script that:
     - Prompts the user to choose an operation: Insert, Update, Delete, or View all users.
     - Based on the user's choice, collect the necessary inputs (e.g., name, age, email, or user ID).
     - Call the appropriate function from dbops.py to perform the operation.

4. **Requirements**:
   - Use a loop to allow the user to perform multiple operations until they choose to exit.
   - Validate user inputs (e.g., ensure age is a number, email is in a valid format, etc.).
   - Display appropriate messages for successful operations or errors.

5. **Example Workflow**:
   - When the script runs, it should display a menu like:
     ```
     Choose an operation:
     1. Insert a new user
     2. Update an existing user
     3. Delete a user
     4. View all users
     5. Exit
     ```
   - Based on the user's choice:
     - For **Insert**: Prompt for `name`, `age`, and `email`, then call `insert_user`.
     - For **Update**: Prompt for `user_id` and the fields to update (`name`, `age`, `email`), then call `update_user`.
     - For **Delete**: Prompt for `user_id`, then call `delete_user`.
     - For **View all users**: Call `fetch_all_users` and display the results.

6. **Submission**:
   - Submit the `userentry.py` file.
   - Ensure the script runs without errors and interacts with the database correctly.

#### Example Code Structure for `userentry.py`:

```python
from dbops import connect_to_db, create_table, insert_user, update_user, delete_user, fetch_all_users

def main():
    db_name = "example.db"
    conn = connect_to_db(db_name)
    create_table(conn)

    while True:
        print("\nChoose an operation:")
        print("1. Insert a new user")
        print("2. Update an existing user")
        print("3. Delete a user")
        print("4. View all users")
        print("5. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            name = input("Enter name: ")
            age = int(input("Enter age: "))
            email = input("Enter email: ")
            insert_user(conn, name, age, email)
            print("User inserted successfully!")
        elif choice == "2":
            user_id = int(input("Enter user ID to update: "))
            name = input("Enter new name (leave blank to skip): ")
            age = input("Enter new age (leave blank to skip): ")
            email = input("Enter new email (leave blank to skip): ")
            update_user(conn, user_id, name=name or None, age=int(age) if age else None, email=email or None)
            print("User updated successfully!")
        elif choice == "3":
            user_id = int(input("Enter user ID to delete: "))
            delete_user(conn, user_id)
            print("User deleted successfully!")
        elif choice == "4":
            users = fetch_all_users(conn)
            print("Users:")
            for user in users:
                print(user)
        elif choice == "5":
            print("Exiting...")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

    conn.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Grading Criteria:
- **Correctness**: The script should correctly perform all CRUD operations based on user input.
- **Input Validation**: Proper validation of user inputs.
- **Code Quality**: Code should be clean, well-structured, and use functions where appropriate.
- **Functionality**: The script should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to the user.

Good luck! ðŸš€---
