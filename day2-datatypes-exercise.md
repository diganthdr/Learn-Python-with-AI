# üß† Python Bootcamp Assignment: Exploring Data Types through Code Modification

## üéØ Objective
Get hands-on experience with Python's built-in data types by reading, modifying, and experimenting with short code snippets.

---

## üîß How to Do This Assignment
1. Copy each code snippet below into your Python environment (VS Code or Cursor).
2. Follow the **modification instructions** in the comments.
3. Before running each modified version, **predict the output**.
4. Run the code, then **write down what you observed**.
5. Use the **observation table** at the end to summarize what you learned.

## üîπ 1. Strings

```python
# Original
name = "Python"
print(name.upper())

# Modify:
# a. Change the string to your own name.
# b. Try .lower(), .capitalize(), and slicing [:3]
```

---

## üîπ 2. Integers and Floats

```python
# Original
a = 10
b = 3
print(a / b)

# Modify:
# a. Try floor division // and check the result.
# b. Convert one value to float and observe.
```

---

## üîπ 3. Lists

```python
# Original
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("mango")
print(fruits)

# Modify:
# a. Remove an element using .remove()
# b. Try accessing the 2nd element with [1]
# c. Replace an element with a new fruit
```

---

## üîπ 4. Tuples

```python
# Original
dimensions = (20, 30)
print(dimensions[0])

# Modify:
# a. Try changing a value (observe the error).
# b. Convert to a list, modify, then convert back to tuple.
```

---

## üîπ 5. Dictionaries

```python
# Original
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 20}
print(student["name"])

# Modify:
# a. Add a new key "grade"
# b. Change "age" to a new value
# c. Try using .get("email") and observe
```

---

## üîπ 6. Sets

```python
# Original
colors = {"red", "blue", "green"}
colors.add("yellow")
print(colors)

# Modify:
# a. Try adding "red" again ‚Äì does anything change?
# b. Use .remove("blue")
```

## üìù Bonus: Observation Table

Use this to summarize your findings for each data type:

| Data Type | What I Modified            | What I Expected     | What Happened        | Why It Happened |
|-----------|-----------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| String    |                             |                      |                        |                  |
| List      |                             |                      |                        |                  |
| Tuple     |                             |                      |                        |                  |
| Dict      |                             |                      |                        |                  |
| Set       |                             |                      |                        |                  |
