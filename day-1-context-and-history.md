# ðŸ§  Setting the Context for AI-Assisted Development

---

## 1. History of Computer Programs

### 1940sâ€“1950s: The Dawn of Programming
- **Machine code**: written in binary (0s and 1s)
- **Assembly language**: used mnemonics, slightly more human-readable
- Example: ENIAC used punched cards and hardwiring

### 1950sâ€“1970s: High-Level Languages
- **FORTRAN**, **COBOL**, **LISP**
- Abstracted away from hardware
- Still required low-level thinking (e.g., memory management)

### 1980sâ€“1990s: General-Purpose Programming
- **C**, **C++**, **Java**, **Python** (late 90s)
- Rise of structured and object-oriented programming
- IDEs like Turbo C++ become popular

### 2000sâ€“2020s: Frameworks and Abstractions
- Java/.NET, Spring, Django, Rails
- Web and mobile development dominate
- More abstraction, faster prototyping

### 2020s+: Code Becomes Collaborative and AI-Assisted
- GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Amazon CodeWhisperer
- Shift from writing code to prompting and collaborating with AI
- Development becomes conversational and iterative

## 2. History of Infrastructure â€“ Monolithic to Cloud Native

### Monolithic Architecture (1960sâ€“2000s)
- All logic (UI + backend + DB access) in one application
- Deployed on physical servers
- Scaling = vertical (more RAM, CPU)

### Client-Server (1990s)
- Logic split between frontend (client) and backend (server)
- Networking becomes a key part of software design

### Service-Oriented Architecture (2000s)
- Introduction of APIs (SOAP, then REST)
- Applications composed of reusable services

### Cloud & Virtualization (Late 2000s)
- AWS (2006) changes how we host and scale software
- Virtual Machines allow flexible, scalable deployments
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) takes off

### Containers & Microservices (2010s)
- Docker and Kubernetes simplify deployments
- Microservices: independent, fine-grained services
- Scalability, CI/CD, resilience become key design goals

### Cloud Native & Serverless (2020s)
- Developers focus on code; the cloud handles the rest
- FaaS (e.g., AWS Lambda) + managed services
- DevOps, observability, automation

### Edge Computing (Emerging)
- Data processing closer to devices/users
- Reduced latency, improved privacy

## 3. History of Development Tools â€“ From Terminal to VibeCoding

### Terminal-Based Editors (1960sâ€“1980s)
- `ed`, `vi`, `emacs`
- Efficient but had a steep learning curve

### Graphical IDEs (1990sâ€“2000s)
- Visual Studio, Eclipse, Turbo Pascal
- Features like syntax highlighting, debugging, and refactoring

### Modern Editors & Collaboration (2010s)
- VS Code, JetBrains, Sublime
- GitHub, CodeSpaces, Live Share enable real-time collaboration
- Cloud-based coding: Replit, Gitpod

### AI-Assisted Development (2020s+)
- Autocomplete evolves to Copilot & beyond
- Context-aware suggestions, code generation, test writing, bug fixing
- **VibeCoding**: seamless, natural-language-based coding with AI support
